  <h1>Caesar Cipher Encoder</h1>
  <p class="main">What is Caesar Cipher?<br /></p>

    The Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another letter located a little further in the alphabet (therefore shifted but always the same for given cipher message).
The shift distance is chosen by a number called the offset, which can be right (A to B) or left (B to A).
For every shift to the right (of +N), there is an equivalent shift to the left (of 26-N) because the alphabet rotates on itself, the Caesar code is therefore sometimes called a rotation cipher.
<p class="main">Why the name Caesar Cipher?</p>
Caesar (Caius Iulius Caesar) used this technique for some correspondences, especially military, for example with Cicerone (shift of 3).

However, it is possible that other civilizations also used it independently.
<p class="main">What is August Cipher?</p>
August Cipher is sometimes the name given to Caesar Cipher with a shift of 1.</p>
